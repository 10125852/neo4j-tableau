== Neo4j Tableau Web Data Connector

This is the code for the Tableau TDE and Web Data Connector.

=== Versions
This code has been tested on Neo4j 2.2 and 2.3 versions. 
This code has been tested against Tableau 9.1.
The TDE format should be able to be read by Tableau versions 7 and higher.

=== TDE ===
To create a TDE, pass in the following query:

Query:

[source,cypher]
----
Match (n:Movie) return n
----

URL:

http://localhost:7474/export/tableau/tde/Match%20(n%3AMovie)%20return%20n


=== Web Data Connector ===
The Web Data Connector requires a small HTML page to pass the query to Neo4j and return the results directly to Tableau.
There is a sample HTML page in the website directory that will allow you to get started.
